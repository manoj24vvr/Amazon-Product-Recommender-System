The compressor came in it\\'s original box with all accessories in their original plastic package and the cords spooled up as if it came from the factory. I haven\\'t yet seen a blemish on the unit itself. It really is in like new condition (and was $60 cheaper than a new unit from Amazon).This compressor is great. I was originally considering the Smart Jet (non-Pro) however what pushed me over is that if you lower the air pressure on the Smart Jet it achieves a lower pressure by a bleed valve which just lets the air run out. The result is that the auto-shutoff feature of the Smart Jet is then rendered useless and the compressor just runs constantly. This compressor however has a true regulator and you can decrease the pressure without loosing the auto-shutoff functionality. It also has a \"protective case\" around it.----------------------------Update October 2012A year and a half later and the compressor is still doing great. I also have a larger shop compressor used for pneumatic tools, and compare to that this unit is way quieter. The tank fills up in about 30 seconds then it shuts off and is quiet. It\\'s nice to be able to paint things at night, 10PM or 11PM, without worrying about how it will affect others in the house or the neighbor. If I had to buy another air brush compressor for some reason... well, I think I might just buy a 2nd one of these.'},\n",

To say that I am vastly disappointed... would be an _understatement_.I purchased the bottle 6-months ago. After first filling my cartridge, I was immediately displeased as the ink was a dark gray color, NOT BLACK. So, I searched the reviews on here and saw complaints about the same issue. However, people suggested that shaking the bottle repeatedly would mix the pigment and thus make it black again. Well, I shook it forcefully for about 20 seconds and refilled the cartridge. No difference whatsoever. So, I emptied the tube and shook it again, this time for 60-seconds. Again, absolutely no difference.So, now 6-months later I found myself needing to refill the pen's cartridge again. Mind you, I stored the ink in a dark drawer, which has not seen the light-of-day since I placed it in there 6-months ago. Low-and-behold absolutely no change / darkening in color. It's still a watery gray color.I would never buy anything Noodlers produces ever again. This was an absolute waste of money for me.Bottom line: if you're a gambling man, or woman, then spin the wheel and hope you get lucky. But, judging by the other reviewers who experienced the same gray color, Noodlers total lack of quality control will be keeping me far, far away from anything they sell.\"},\n",

As in, you write \"Noodler\\'s Ink\" on one side of a paper, then flip the paper over and you can see the pressure point from when you applied pressure to get the ink onto the paper.Fantastic ink, a bit on the pricey side.

       "  'review/text': \"After buying a Lamy Safari on a whim, upon reading all of the rave reviews about Noodlers Ink I decided I would give it a shot. Unfortunately, I cannot share the enthusiasm other people have about this ink.Since I am new to fountain pens, I don't have a lot to compare it to other than the default cartridge the Safari comes with. Whereas the default cartridge wrote smoothly and, aside for a few issues here and there, consistently, the Noodlers Ink comes out unevenly and only when it feels like coming out. I find myself having to rewrite letters/words every sentence or so, which makes writing an incredible nuisance. The Lamy cartridge put down a dark color, while this Noodlers comes out a dull grey for me, despite hearing claims of it being extremely black.And finally, being a lefty, quickly-drying ink is of utmost importance. I would have to try pretty hard to get the Lamy cartridge's ink to smudge, but the Noodlers takes an immensely long time to dry, forcing me to do all-too-familiar hand acrobatics games as I write. It is no exaggeration to say that this ink was still wet after five minutes. Maybe it's a good thing that the ink doesn't come out consistently after all!Basically, my point is this: I couldn't really be more displeased with this ink than I am. If I hadn't used the Lamy cartridge before having tried this ink, I probably would have felt as though buying the pen was a gigantic waste of money. I'm not turned off from fountain pens yet, but I am turned off of this ink. Perhaps it works well for those of you with larger nibs, but it is next to useless in my EF. I'm not sure what to do with the rest of this bottle, or what ink I should try next. Sigh.\"},\n",

I tried again a few years ago and the pen broke in less than a year. I thought I'd try one more time. As I still had bottled ink left over,I decided I'd use that before purchasing any new ink. I'm glad my thriftiness did not overcome my desire for permanence. I was very surprised. Very smooth writing ink,AMAZING! No tug or pull on the paper and it doesn't seem to bleed through. I prefer a blue ink, but haven't yet found any. Besides, I really like this ink...I'll probably just adjust myself to writing in black.\"},\n",

It writes and dries black.I was also curious how quick it would dry. As I am a left-hander whom writes overhand (you know the weird way lefties write and everyone else says How you write like that?&#34;). So I end up dragging my hand through my writing and smudging it. Well, not with this stuff, it dries quick. Now it will smudge a little on high-gloss paper like credit card solicitations and junk mail. So if you are jotting down a honey-do list use regular paper.It says that this ink only bonds to celluloid (paper) and not your skin and I guess cloths? I can testify that it will wash off my hands with little scrubbing unlike India Ink. But I haven't gotten any on my cloths. I do question the clothing thing, since most are made of cotton, which I think is cellulose and used in paper? It's been a while since biology class, I may be in left field on that one.All in all, well worth the money, and doesn't seem to dry out in the pen or get crusty and is rich black.\"},\n",

This \"nib creep\" is harmless behavior because the ink doesn\\'t run down onto the grip area. Wiping the ink off the nib is only temporary; more ink will soon spread to replace what you wiped off. Again, this is harmless behavior and a very small price to pay for the security of your marks, signatures and important handwritten texts.'},\n",

Noodler\\'s black bonds with paper using cellulose-reactive dyes, and that bond is extremely strong.When using a wet pen, sometimes extra ink is laid down on the paper. The ink that bonds with the cellulose is permanent, but any extra ink that\\'s laying on top is not. Water will rinse away the excess ink, but the writing will be as strong and as solid as when it was first written.I\\'ve found Noodler\\'s black very easy to rinse out of my pens and off of my skin. Because the ink has to bond with cellulose to become permanent, it rinses very easily compared to other inks labeled as \"permanent\". It will bond with the cellulose in cotton fabric, so be careful not to spill it on cotton clothes. Pour it on synthetic fabrics, though, and it comes right out. I had a small spill on my carpet, and I cleaned it up with paper towels and water, without leaving any stain behind. Additionally, Noodler\\'s black is pH neutral, so it won\\'t eat through some metals the way acidic inks can.I\\'ve been using Noodler\\'s black for years, and it\\'s performed flawlessly as I\\'ve worked my way through multiple bottles.'},\n",

       "  'review/text': \"The bottle the ink came in was filled to the brim, which was very satisfying to a penny-pincher like me. Bulletproof black flows nicely out of my charcoal Lamy Safari with a Fine nib; it also complements the color of the pen very nicely. Like other reviews have noted, the ink performs much better than expected on even poor quality paper. But it also kind of depends on the size of the nib you're using and how wet your pen writes. But in most of the pens I've used, there hasn't been too much variance.The color of the ink is just a touch lighter than I would like, but its very dark nonetheless. I'm not too sure if the product info page lists it, but the bulletproof black is fraud-proof and pretty much permanent on paper. The ink works by bonding chemically to cellulose, the stuff paper is made of, but it'll wash out of your hands and pen without too much difficulty. Just make sure you don't spill the ink on a white shirt or something.Just as a warning, some fountain-pen users and some repair-guys don't encourage the use of Noodler's bulletproof black in fountain pens due to the possibility of clogging due to the high solute content in the ink. But if you're using a fairly inexpensive pen, like the Lamy Safari, then it really isn't that much of a concern. From what I can tell, the potential damage is VERY minimal, especially compared to the great qualities of this ink. The only other potential problem I can see with the bottle they provide is when the ink level is really low; it'll make refilling with a converter or piston kind of difficult. The way I plan on getting around this is by using a syringe to refill my old cartridges. But I can definitely see how the bottle design could pose a problem for refills.\"},\n",

When it came to replace the ink, I decided to fill the converter with Noodler's (rather than use one of the disposable cartridges that came with the set) to see if I could tell the difference. It was night and day. I literally stopped mid-line changed ink, and it was astounding. Rather than being pulled through the paper and spreading out like the Sheaffer ink did, the Noodler's stayed right where I wrote. This led to a much more pronounced effect in my writing, with much sharper edges on my calligraphy. I was having trouble getting the squared look before, but now my thicks are squared and my thins remain thin. I recommend this ink to anyone that is considering using bottled ink over cartridges.

       "  'review/text': 'When researching inks (the Fountain Pen Network forum is a great resource), one will quickly find that Noodler\\'s Ink is very popular among those interested. The company produces an unusually wide selection of inks. Despite this range, each ink is generally well-balanced and behaved. Their Bulletproof Black is no exception - it\\'s a very well behaved ink that doesn\\'t feather or bleed. The fact that it\\'s waterproof on paper gives me peace of mind, and if I wrote checks, I would probably do it with this ink. The only negative thing that I can think of is that this ink and many other Noodler\\'s Inks exhibit so-called \"nib-creep.\" While writing, you\\'ll notice that some ink comes out of the slit on the nib and creeps outwards. Some may consider this unattractive, but I\\'d say that the other positives greatly outweigh this problem. Besides, I sort of like the look of a little ink on the nib.An individual bottle of Noodler\\'s ink may seem a little expensive at first, but when I buy one, I really feel like I\\'m getting my money\\'s worth. Each bottle is 3 ounces, which, in case you don\\'t have a fountain pen, lasts a very long time. I\\'m a college student, and even if I write with the same ink for an entire semester, every day, I\\'d be surprised if I\\'d make it a third of the way through the bottle.To be honest, I think that Noodler\\'s Ink makes a good role model for a small businesses. They\\'re very generous in the amount of ink per bottle - each one is literally filled to the brim; make sure you don\\'t spill when you first open it! And of course, they\\'re based in the USA, which gives me a little sense of pride. Overall, the ink and the company behind it deserve 5 stars.Amazon, on the other hand, could do some improvement. The ink was pretty poorly packaged, and I felt that it was a little miracle that it didn\\'t shatter during shipping. Amazon or whoever packages it should put some more bubble wrap around the ink bottle to be safe.'},\n",

       "  'review/text': \"First off, I need to point out that the ink is not completely waterproof. You can't use waterproof ink in fountain pens because it will dry out your pen. This ink gets it's waterproofness by binding with the cellulose in paper. If you're writing, you may not care about this. I use this pen to draw with, so I need something *completely* waterproof that won't run when I apply watercolors. This ink WILL run. The reason is, when I write with it there's a thin layer on ink that is sitting on top of more ink, that hasn't gotten the chance to bind with the paper. This ink is thus not waterproof. It also smudges when I use an eraser on top of it, which makes it hard to clean up pencil under sketches.My solution is to make my own ink by using 2 parts noodler's with 1 part water. This dilutes the ink enough that it binds with my paper completely and I can erase over it with no problems. This ink is also black enough that diluting doesn't affect the blackness at all. It's definitely the smoothest, darkest ink I have used (significantly darker than Parker / Speedball / Blick / Higgins / Winsor and Newton inks, even after dilution), hence the 5 stars.\"},\n",

In any event, it's by no means slow-drying. It's also definitely waterproof; all the other reviews don't lie. I know the dyes bond with cellulose, making a mark that can't be washed away, but having seen it in action, I'm pretty sure it's just magic.As for the color, it is a pure black. Don't expect all your writing to convey the darkness of beyond the event horizon; quick writing with a fine nib will still leave some under-covered spots showing a little grayishness, but you certainly won't see any purple/blue fringing or anything like that.\"},\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Review of 'Noodler's Black Waterproof Fountain Pen Ink - Bulletproof'First of all, I love this product. I highly recommend it and I would definitely buy it again.Here's why: It is black as opposed to blue black, it is smooth, it glides easily, there is no smudging as it dries quickly on paper but never on the nib, and it works beautifully on my Moleskine notebook as it does on regular (cheap) ruled notebook paper. I doubt it is meant to be used to draw, however, I used it to do some quick calligraphy on a used, dry coffee filter and it worked with minimal (insignificant) bleeding even on that coarse paper.Type of pens used: (1) Waterman classic (France), medium nib, with twist converter cartridge. (2) Alvin Reform Refographs (Germany - two decades old), sizes .50 (size 2) and .30 (size 00). Because the Waterman was clean and completely dry when I filled the cartridge, the ink flows pretty much solid black. Because the Refographs were freshly washed and the cartridge as well as the nib casing contained water, the ink flow varies from grey (more of a heather grey than a bluish grey) to black. Under no conditions have I seen any bleeding from this ink, not even when spotted with drops of water (once dry on paper). Big thumbs up from me.Because the ink comes in a glass bottle a few inches high, and the ink is nearly overflowing over the rim of the bottle, it is very easy to reload the Waterman twist converter. I am not sure how I will 'suck' up the ink from the bottom of the bottle once I use it up. For the Refographs, because they have disposable cartridges that I have always refilled, I used a new nose/ear bulb (yeah, yeah, the blue ones used to extract boogers from babies' noses!) from the pharmacy to refill the cartridges. But I'm pretty sure any other dropper or even a syringe would have worked as well as long as the whole refilling process is done with care. Perhaps I will do the same with the Waterman converter when its time comes around.While some reviewers criticize the ink as not being 100% black, I found that for the way I use my pens, mainly for writing, the ink is more than adequate in opacity and in warmth (I cannot stress enough how I dislike blue black inks - just personal preference). I hope this review helps you.\"},\n",

Watery. Not dense. The only time I couldn't see through it to the paper is when I applied it with a brush. For that, I have a fabulous array of India inks etc to choose from. Even with a brush pen it was more charcoal than black.I will try more of Noodler's Inks, but this one is not the black that will make me stop looking for a better one.\"},\n",

       "  'review/text': 'I\\'ve been using Noodler\\'s Bulletproof Black for about six months in a variety of fountain pens. I have a number of pens, use several papers, and have more than a handful of different inks. My bottle of Noodler\\'s BB has more removed from it than my other colors.Once dry, this ink is permanent. That\\'s what I wanted (originally for my journals) and that\\'s what I got. BB is also well-behaved in the pens I use it in. This list includes several Parker 51s, a couple of Esterbrooks, a Waterman Phileas, and a Lamy Al-Star.Beware if you are considering using it in a dry-writer -- you might not like the flow. For example, I originally bought my Lamy Al-Star with an extra-fine nib. That\\'s a relatively dry-writing nib and the flow from that pen was insufficient for my writing style. Use of a slightly wetter-writing Fine nib solved the problem, but it is something to watch for.Others mention \"nib-creep\" -- the tendency for some inks to leave the space between the nib\\'s tines and coat the nib lightly. This bothers some people (not me) so be aware that it might happen. It\\'s harmless to the pen, at least in my experience. Hooded pens (like the Parker 51 and others) hide this but I\\'m sure it\\'s there.BB dries fairly quickly and bonds with the paper as it does. I have not experienced much feathering, bleeding, or ghosting with BB on a variety of papers, including standard copy paper, Moleskine journals, and higher-quality papers like Clairfontaine and heavy HP laser-printer paper.Did I mention that it\\'s BLACK? :) I suppose there are other inks available that might be more black, but BB is black. My favorite rollerball (and my go-to pens before I jumped to fountain pens) was a Uniball Signo DX (hard to find in the US) in black. BB is just as black as the ink in that rollerball.In short, if you\\'re looking for a black, permanent ink for a fountain pen, Noodler\\'s BB can do the job. It\\'s relatively fast-drying and as permanent as any ink can be. It\\'s recommended.'},\n",

I also read reviews questioning the \"Bulletproof\" qualities of this ink (water proof, forgery proof, etc.) and the \"blackness\" of the color. All this made me just a little bit nervous in making the purchase.However, after some thought, reason and logic kicked in and I just went ahead and bought it. Am I happy with my decision?

I mean, the ink does smudge just a tad bit if you wet your finger and run it across the page, but it will not come off the page and is still very legible.

It looks more expensive than it really is but this pen is no longer produced by Cross. I purchased the fountain pen to set my writing apart from other's on legal documents at my place of employment. (this simple application of a fountain pen has saved me many headaches) One person in the field who was seriously incompetent finally caused me to blow my cork after dealing with his idiocy for five years. Before I knew it, I had thrown my fountain pen against the console. The damage that resulted was the plastic under the gold point lost about a millimeter at the tip. The ink no longer flowed properly. I have since purchased 2 more Cross pens, a Parker and finally a Lamy. None feel as good as the black and gold Cross I damaged in a stupid fit. (in my defense...it did take 5 years for me to reach my breaking point) I have also tried 3 different types of ink and none seemed to work well in the other pens either. I always had to kick start the line before I could write. I purchased this Noodler's ink as a last ditch effort and low and behold, it worked well on ALL the pens. On a whim, I tried it on my old #1 Cross pen and it brought the old girl back to life. This American made ink is OUTSTANDING! It flows well but does not pour out of the pen like water from a tap. I have read a review that said it was clumpy. I know mixing inks in a pen can cause clumps if the pen is not thoroughly cleaned before changing inks. All I know is that this ink could have saved me some bank had I purchased it from the get go as I now, once again, only use my black and gold Cross and the other purchased fountain pens sit in a pewter holder at home.\"},\n",

I find it not to be so, especially on card stock. It fails my inmediate smear test (1 or 2 seconds, seems ok after 6 seconds). If you think that is too short, my Quink ink passes this test easily, same with the ink on my disposable pens (Pilot Varsity, Itoya Blade, even my Platinum preppy). The smear is about par with the ink that came in my Lamy safary.The cap appears to be a bit cheap, I dropped it and cracked the cap (while inside the box it came with), so you do have to be careful (the Quink bottle cap looks very strong made, for comparison).On the plus side, it is the only ink I have tried that will not bleed through cheap paper, even when I intentionally scribbled in one small spot, laying a lot of ink. All others I tried bleed through when doing that.But this is permanent ink, so be sure to carry it in a pen carrier in your pocket, not by itself, just in case. It will bond to paper and clothes. But it washes off without too much trouble from my fingers (my Quink is hard to wash off).'},\n",

It doesn't flow well from the nib and it dries to more of a gray than a real black. I'm very surprised because all of the other reviews I read said that it was a very black black. The other ink I have used in my Lamy is Noodlers Polar Brown, which makes the pen handle much more smoothly. I think I might go for the polar black and see how that works for me. Perhaps I got a bottle from a bad batch, or maybe its just not a good match for the extra fine nib I'm using. Either way, from my experiences so far I wouldn't recommend getting this ink.Update 10/23/12:After my initial review this ink started to change the way it handled in my pen. It may have been that I had cleaned my pen out prior to using it so it was a little watered down. Now I love it. It flows smoothly, and is very fine writing experience. The initial bottle I bought has lasted me 3 years and it is only half gone! Get it, you won't be disappointed.\"},\n",

A lot of users with either the ink and/or pen complain because they haven\\'t done this- When you first get this bottle, slowly open it as you will see that it is filled to the brim with ink!On the most conventional paper like 20lb copier paper or filler paper, this ink won\\'t bleed through the other side (unless you put blobs of ink then it will). Feathering, nope. But it may on other papers, I haven\\'t experienced any. The darkness of this ink is as black as Pilot gel ink as used in the Pilot G-2 pen. Drying time is about a few seconds if not less than that.When filling my pen, the ink level in the bottle barely went down (and that\\'s saying something, my pen holds more than a cartridge). This should last me a long time.For more detailed information on the \"Bulletproof\" qualities on this ink, visit the company\\'s website, but in short it is (supposedly, I have no reason to test them) water proof, bleach proof, as well as archival quality. Good thing it washes off hands easily!Seeing as you\\'ll be dipping the body of the pen into ink, you should know the ink will drip off a plastic body (like celluloid) as you pull the pen out so no worries about having to grip an inky pen. I will say this, \"nib-creep\" as described by other reviewers, I have experienced as well. Wiping the nib clean will only bring up more ink so I just leave it alone. No biggy, I have 3 oz. of ink anyway.UPDATE 2/5/2013: Works well with the Parker 45 with the Deluxe Parker Converter. When using a Fine nib, this thing lays down a little more ink than the Noodler\\'s Ahab, but it glides on copier paper like glass.'},\n",

It glided flawlessly in my Lamy and with a dip pen.- Very black.- Quick-drying. I've used it to take all my notes in college. I never had to wait for it to dry on notebook paper or flashcards; the only time it took a moment was with shiny cardstock (which is an awful surface, and it still dried fairly quickly!)- Large amount of ink.Cons:- Pervasively stains hands/very hard to remove from non-paper surfaces. I didn't lower the rating, since this is something you should expect of a permanent ink! Still, since I spilled almost the entire bottle, I did have to confront how insidiously difficult the stuff is to clean up.- Weak lid that did not resist a small drop. While the bottle/lid were fine for normal use, you may want to move the ink into a new bottle if you're clumsy. I knocked mine over the edge of a low table (1 to 1 1/2 feet) onto a hard floor; the lid immediately cracked and flew off, and I was down one (mostly full!) bottle of ink! This has nothing to do with the ink, however, and there's no real reason it should come in a deluxe bottle, so the rating remains a 5.All in all, I'm most certainly ordering another bottle of this black!

I only sign my checks with this ink now.Update: I bought a Z24 converter for my Lamy Safari Extra Fine nib fountain pen so that I can use the Noodler ink. Surprisingly, the Noodler Black ink seems lighter and more watery from the Safari XF nib than from the Hero XF nib. The original Safari blue cartridge that came with the pen had a richer line. In addition, there is now a smear on the nib whereas there was none with the Lamy cartridge. Since I used the same ink for two different pens with two vastly different results, I must conclude that it's the nib that is causing the difference and not the ink itself.I downgraded this ink to 4* since it was a little disappointing that the ink did not exhibit the same characteristics in 2 different pens.\"},\n",

It flows wonderfully through all of them, they write smoother, the ink is jet black opaque. Reminds me of the Higgins drafting ink I used to use in Rapidograph pens years ago. Lately I'm using it in my new Lamy All Sport pen with the Lamy converter and an EF nib. Who cares if ink streaks on the nib? After a year my Namiki was not flowing well so I took it down and flushed it with tap water and rinsed with distilled water (in case the Noodler's was sensitive to the minerals, etc. in my tap water). That was several months ago and the Namiki writes great. Sometimes pens should be cleaned out periodically. I refill the Waterman and Namiki cartridges using a syringe and reuse the cartridges (flushed the old ink out of them before adding Noodler's). I am going to use Noodlers Polar Brown in a Stipula Passaporta italic pen for calligraphy or handwritten letters. By the way, Noodler's ink will not attack any metals. Other inks can corrode metals. Visit Noodler's web site. Or, add other ink to a piece of aluminum foil and see it eat a hole in the foil over a day or so. Noodler's will not. Shake the bottle before you fill your pen. If it gets too thick dilute it with a little distilled water (I have not needed to do that yet).\"},\n",

       "  'review/text': 'So I read the reviews and expected this to be the be-all, end-all of black ink. It\\'s... okay.I am told it is waterproof and solvent-proof and ultimately \"bullet-proof\". I am not sure how much of a problem that is really solving, since I have signed mortgages with generic ballpoints, but let\\'s say that it\\'s very secure ink by some standard, and set that aside. It will still smudge weeks later, in any case.In more practical terms, this is not what I expected. It\\'s smudgy and inky and \"wet-looking\" on, for example, post-it notes, envelopes, and office-paper. It takes a minute or two to dry, and leaves a \"watery\" look, not the solid-black \"comic book\" look I was hoping for based on the name and reviews.I am right-handed and I cannot imagine that this could possibly work for lefties. I start smudging when my hand brushes the previous line on ordinary office paper. Maybe I am not writing on sufficiently high-quality paper, or maybe I am writing too fast for this ink, but I had the impression that this was some kind of fast-drying, no-feather \"superblack\", like what you get in good drafting/artist/technical pens, or maybe even like good roller-gel ballpoints, except with the fluidity and stroke-quality of a fountain-pen.On the plus side, it flows well and instantly from the pen, with manageable bleeding/feathering. I don\\'t have reason to doubt to archival/security claims, but those also seem like a solution in search of a problem, so to speak... if anything I write will ever be needed a thousand years from now, well, I hope someone will have copied it by then, and fading ink is not at the top of the list of destructibility/losability fears for me. Take it as you will.On the minus, or at least \"no better than cheap india ink\" side, this ink takes a good minute or two to dry on regular office paper using a fine-point Lamy nib. It also leaves a grayish, watery look, not a deep and consistent black, as I expected. Bleed and feathering are manageable, but this is not like writing/drawing with, say, a Koh-I-Noor drafting pen and ink.The dried ink on the page looks soaked-in and watery-gray. It\\'s not \"bad\" or \"wet\" in terms of bleed/feathering, but it\\'s not like the hard-edged bead of deep black that I thought it would be.As a writing ink, it\\'s not fast-drying enough and offers only adequate appearance. As an artist\\'s ink, it is flawed and inadequate. It offers neither the deep black nor crisp edges for detailed drawing.I don\\'t doubt the security claims, so take those as they are worth to you. But as an everyday writing ink, this is only so-so. As a drawing ink, it fails.'},\n",

       "  'review/text': 'I was using Monte blanc ink and I love the shape of that ink well. The ink itself is lacking because it tends to smudge and runs easily with just a drop of water. So I did a search for waterproof ink and found this product. I have to say I am thoroughly impressed. I write about 10-20 pages a day as class notes and writing creatively. The ink does not feather as you write and stays in a crisp and clear line on most paper except glossy magazine cover. But even then once it dried I could place it under the sink faucet and wet it and it held up better than the ink already printed on the paper. Overall a wonderful product. However, I have one complaint. The shape of the bottle will undoubtedly cause problems later, as I use up a lot of ink. It will become difficult to fill the pen cartridge as the bottle empties.Update:I forget exactly when I bought this, The review says last January so I must have bought it before then. So a year now and I haven\\'t used as much of this ink at all. I write A LOT. This ink really does go far. I have filled up a moleskin notebook, half of a second one, written college class notes and papers, and written a two person RPG with a friend of mine taking up almost an entire pack\\'s worth of notebook paper. \"Wow\" is all I can say. I\\'ve used up the ink only in the very top of the bottle. I\\'ve only recently reached the top of the label. I am getting to the point of transferring this ink to a different bottle but I was shocked when I realized how long it had been.'},\n",

Have been using it for about a month, almost daily during that time.At first the ink was drying dark grey. I was disappointed. Then I started using a different kind of paper and refilling the converter by dipping the nib into the ink instead of trying to refill the converter by itself. After that, black ink. I suspect it was more the paper than the ink filling method that made the ink black or gray. It's been a nice black on every paper I have used it on since that first day though.Waterproof. Dries very quickly (almost instantly) on every paper I have used it on, even - to my surprise - parchment. Smudge proof almost immediately - within about a second for me. Flows nicely. Nice density. And even though I am going through it rather quickly at one refill every four days (as I am filling up a very detailed research journal which must be archival), there is still lots and lots left.You do get nib creep, but that doesn't do anything. I don't care if there's ink on the nib. I care if it writes smoothly, is waterproof, and works well in my pen. It does. So...as far as I know about pens and ink...

       "  'review/text': \"Noodler's (Bullet Proof) Black is a good, very saturated black ink for use in any fountain pen.What I like about the ink:- It's really black. Not the blackest ink in existence, but it's much blacker than other widely available black inks.- It's one of the few fountain pen inks that's really waterproof. It can withstand great punishment without washing off the paper at all.- It flow really well. Almost all fountain pens can use this ink without any problems.- It lubricates the pen really well, writing with this ink in combination with a good fountain pen is will make the pen glide across the paper.- It comes in a large, filled to the brim bottle.What I don't like about the ink:- If you have a pen that's prone to nib creep, this ink will creep. It won't diminish your writing experience, but ink can pool on the top of the nib.- It's hard to clean. Once you're done with this ink, flushing your pen might take a little longer than you're used to.I can recommend this ink to anyone who is looking for a good, permanent, black ink. I gives this ink 5/5, minus one for the nib creep and difficulty to clean. (Though it's not the worst I've ever seen.)\"},\n",

It isn't a competition game as much as it is a cooperation game, so if having a clear cut winner is what you want, this probably isn't the game for you.Each player has a farm with four different crops to harvest before autumn turns to winter. You roll the die to determine which crop you may pick or if you have to move everyone closer to winter. If winter comes before the crops are harvested, then there might not be enough food for winter, but the object is for everyone to harvest their crops before the onset of winter.The neat thing about this game is that really the best way to get the harvest in is for everyone to work together to harvest each other's crops and not just work individually on your own crop. There is an additional element (which we have not yet played) to the game where you can plant the garden first and then harvest it. It is for more advanced players, but I think a young player could easily play it too after having played the easier version a few times.I highly recommend this game for families of all ages. It's been a blessing to watch the kids want to help other players more than they want to harvest their own crop!\"},\n",

Great set for beginners and you can usually find this set for 50% off which is great. The markers life span is pretty decent, I filled 3 sheets 11x17 with black marker for some rough sketches and it still has some juice left. You might want to add a greyscale set to this kit because it only comes with 20/50/70% greyscale of french/cool/warm greys. A fun set.\"},\n",

       "  'review/text': \"These markers are absolutely wonderful! I've been a huge fan of Prismacolor colored pencils for years now so I decided I would try something a little different. I really can't use anything but Prismacolor products anymore because no other brand really stands up to their quality.All of the colors are brilliant and also *blend* with eachother instead of bleeding together or leaving you with an unfortunate brown-black. You can even blend totally conflicting colors (think pink and green) and still make out each color. As for colors that naturally blend, they look amazing.I do have a few very minor quips, however. The packaging is a bit cheap compared to the grand quality of the markers themselves and the markers don't want to stay in their individual grooves. Also, the color of the marker on the outside is normally a bit different than what the ink turns out being on paper. So, what I suggest is to take a piece of scrap paper and make a color catalogue (with the names of the colors) so you can see exactly what the finished product will look like.\"},\n",

It might be the problem of my computer monitor since I've never got it color adjusted, most of the color labels on the markers don't match with the color plate on Prismacolor website, and the labels don't match with the actual color of the marker (sorry about the long sentence) I have to look them up by their names. You may want to create your own color plate just as I did, or test each marker out before you use them on your artwork.-it blends beautifully.-the colors are a lot lighter when they are dry.-the package can be better. It doesn't fits the markers perfectly, but I found it convenient as a shelf on my table.in general, I absolutely enjoy working with those markers.\"},\n",

I love prismacolor markers, they're not copics, but they do justice with a great color variety, blending, and more importantly, price.But when buying this product, I would tell people to make sure they count them to make sure they're all there! I thought maybe it was just me, but after putting them all in order I noticed I was missing PM-25, Spring green. I asked Amazon's service if they could just send me the missing marker, but apparently all they could do was give me a refund. I decided against the refund because I still got 71 out of the 72 and I only paid half the price due to Christmas (thank you gift cards).Eitherway, great product, fast shipping, just make sure you count them accordingly, because you might miss one without noticing it (72 markers are quite a handful afterall).\"},\n",

       "  'review/text': \"I remember when these markers were much better, with a fine point on one end and a thick slanted point on the other. They've always been expensive, but I justified their price because they last such a long time.The entire marker has changed since I bought them many years ago. The fine tip is no longer fine. It is a like a regular sharpie point. The ink standard has gone down too. The color is not rich like it used to be and the markers do not last AT ALL. I know all alcohol markers bleed through but the deep reds and purples bleed heavily the first few uses then Poof! the ink is gone. And with some of the other colors, they barely color at all, like the pen marker has dried out already. For 150+ dollars, these won't cut it for me, I returned them within hours of receiving them. I was practically waiting by the door for them too.I did some research online with the help of some of the reviews on Amazon for these Prismas and I saw that the Copic line was recommended. I ordered a couple of Copic original markers (singly this time so I wouldn't have to bother with a huge return) and the quality is much, much better though you have to pay a lot for it (if you get lucky, around 4 bucks a marker which is pretty steep!) But if you're already willing to shell out a buck and a half on these, you might as well just go for it and just get the Copic original markers which you can refill and change the nibs out for, they'll last forever. If you're missing the prismas of old, I highly recommend the Copic Original Markers. I didn't like the Copic Sketch or the Copic Ciaos, I do a lot of detail work, and those markers tips are much too broad for me. Plus I like having 9 different nib options, that's awesome.I am very impressed so far with the few Copics I've ordered. The color is rich and addictive, like any good marker should be. I look forward to using them and have already used them quite a bit. For the sophisticated artist/sketcher/designer, the Copic website even has a full color wheel to access so you can make an informed decision on which ones will best suit your needs. Don't be swayed by the droves of stampers loving these markers either, they are great markers for sketch artists too.\"},\n",

I even went the extra mile, and instead of waiting until my paper arrived, I went out to buy some marker paper at Michaels (Canson Comic Book Art Boards, really awesome!). The only complaints I have is the marker stand seems cheap, one marker came in with a broken tip, and another one has a dry tip on one side. I'm sure that won't happen to everybody though, and it was a big set, so going out to buy a couple of markers at a time won't be a huge problem for me. I can just see where I need to go from this set :)Hope it was a helpful review!\"},\n",

       "  'review/text': 'I had a great time testing out this cordless glue gun. It has several handy features and works very well.I was skeptical about the cordless feature, as some in the past have not worked as well as my corded version. Let me explain how the cordless action works on this glue gun. It is very similar to our cordless drill. The battery snaps into the bottom of the handle. To charge, it fits into a small charger which can be kept anywhere near an outlet. The charger flashes a green light while charging and then a steady light once charged. The initial charge took just a couple of hours. The instructions say the battery has no \"memory effect\" - it can be put back on the charger even if it\\'s not fully discharged.With the battery, the glue gun weighs less than 12 ounces. It feels very comfortable to hold and use. The glue gun has a trigger so glue only comes out when you need it, and a work light at the tip that illuminates exactly where you are working. The light can be switched from high to low intensity.There\\'s a clear window on top so you can easily see when to add another glue stick. This gun takes mini-size low temperature or all-purpose glue sticks. Cold Heat also sells glue sticks just for this gun, that they say will maximize battery life.Right by the opening for the glue sticks, there are two small lights. One is a low battery indicator and the other is the PowerSave indicator. If you do not move the glue gun for eight minutes, it switches to this mode and stops heating the glue. As soon as you move it, it heats up again.The glue heating time was very quick. The gun is well-made and easy to use. It does not drip when resting, which keeps your workspace much cleaner. The FreeStyle Cordless Glue Gun is packed with features and works great.'},\n",

       "  'review/text': \"The cordless feature makes this glue gun very handy. Heat up time is 3 or 4 minutes, and the applicator puts out a nice fine line of glue.But, this is a light duty gun. Too much pressure on the trigger, in an effort to get a faster flow, has the effect of cooling the tip and stopping the flow for a second. Also, that same forcing of the trigger causes the advance mechanism to scrape the top of the glue stick and it won't advance at all till you ease up and slow down.Of course, if you are doing these things, you need a heavier duty glue gun. You can find them at www.glu-stix.com, all the way up to industrial strength with pnumatic force feeders.For most of us, and most of the tasks we want the glue gun for, this one is great.As a side note, the glu-stix.com site has bulk boxes of mini sticks, and special purpose glue sticks as well.\"},\n",

Like any product, it has its pros and cons, so allow me to list them.Pros:Cordless products are easier to use anywhere you need them, incuding outside the house.It heats and cools quickly.Unlike most corded glue guns, it has an On/Off switch, and barely drips at all.It has a work light at the front, and a standby mode to conserve battery power.It includes a small idea book that I found very helpful. Read it to learn how to avoid the little strings of glue that can be a problem at the end of a job.You can buy a spare battery for it at coldheat.com. (Other reviewers said batteries were not available, but they just recently started selling them)Cons:It does not come with a storage case, and ColdHeat does not sell one online. (I put it in a small plastic tool box)It uses only Mini sticks (5/16\" diameter) so it is good for light work, but if you need a lot of glue, you will have to add sticks frequently.The charging base has an indicator light (a good thing) but it is VERY bright. Don\\'t charge it anywhere near your bedroom at night, or the light will keep you up.My needs are strictly light-duty so it is an excellent choice for me. Gotta go now. I have to look around the house for stuff to glue! :)'},\n",

I was pleased to discover that they do in fact make smaller \"dots.\" My main gripe with this particular set is the colors, which aren\\'t quite what we were expecting.

Since everything can be slid around, the magnifying glass can still be over what I'm working on, and I have the 'hands' close enough together to hold smaller things. I also put a strip of electrical tape around the clips to put a little protection between them and what I'm holding, so there's no risk of scratching what I'm working on. The base is surprisingly heavy so I can use it for anything small enough to fit on there and balance. The one other thing it could use is a light--to me that would give it a 5 out of 5 rating. It was very inexpensive, and worth way more than it cost. I'm very pleased with the purchase and will recommend it to my friends.\"},\n",

I use some small spring clamps clipped into to the clips it comes with, it keeps them from scratching whatever I'm working on. If you are going to be doing PCB, you should probably get a Panavise Jr. This product is really good for making cables though. It's good for clipping a connector into one end, and the wire into the other. The magnifying glass is difficult to use while soldering, but it might be better for other uses. You also can't get it far enough away to really see anything.\"},\n",

       "  'review/text': 'I purchased this album so that I could do two-page spreads without having a gap in the middle--and without the hassle and expense of buying all new (and very expensive) strap pages.Well, when I ran out of the 10 page sleeves that come with the album, I tried adding pages using some sleeves that I had on hand. Most sleeves were too big, showing outside the covers when the album is closed. You pretty much have to buy Pioneer RMB-5 refill pages or have the page hangout problem. I bought five albums. On one of them, the snap fittings came unglued. If you put too many pages in, you risk not having enough plastic strapping to press down into the fittings.Overall, it\\'s an ingenious design. It\\'s relatively easy to add more pages. The slots for the \"spine\" piece are really easy to use, so the spine piece for this album doesn\\'t tear like the ones with the holes in them. You don\\'t have to fool with screwing screws in straight or losing the little pieces. You may have to trim the side edges of your 12 x 12 paper so that it slides into the sleeves smoothly, without bending. Too bad Pioneer didn\\'t make the covers just a tiny bit bigger!!'},\n",

I'm able to create a perfect overlock stitch with minimal effort. I have a Brother XL3750 machine with an included overlock stitch, but the machine has a tendency to pull the fabric to the left so my stitches stretch out from my trying to pull the fabric to the right to keep it on track. This foot has a little piece in the middle where the threads overlay and I think this is what takes the tension off of the fabric in order to keep everything distributed evenly.I may still get a serger someday, but this meets all of my needs for now!\"},\n",

In order to get the ones in my size, I needed to purchase the ones that were BLUE and Black. I had wanted Black on Black, but they were sold out. Thanks to Fiebings Leather Dye, I now have the color that I wanted from the very start ! I used acetone nail polish remover to deglaze the boots and then gave them three nice coats of Fiebings Leather Dye. I used a stiff art brush that had a 1/2\" bristle which allowed me to work the dye into the leather around the hard plastic protective areas that the boots are made with. I then finished them up with a layer of Kiwi black shoe polish and they look brand new; and also as if they were Black all along.'},\n",

It's very black and stains..(as it should!) so be careful not to drip it on wood floors.. or get it on your hands.. it'll take a day or two before it fades/washes off your skin. A little goes a long way. So far I've used this product to darken shoes that started to fade, I've also used it touch up black furniture, purses, and it gave me such a nice rich black color that I even used it to stain a bathroom cabinet to match a black medicine cabinet. I didn't even sand the cabinet... it was a medium pecan colored brown. I just started painting it with the little swabby thing, did two coats and it looks great and is dry to the touch! I would not recommend doing that for large projects.. but if you have a small piece of furniture that doesn't get handled a lot and needs to be black.. it's great in a pinch. I went on a kick and started darkening all the black shoes I could find in the house and touching up all the furniture. And then I ran out.. so i bought another bottle. This little bottle of black magic is fantastic.\"},\n",

       "  'review/text': \"We have a camel/light brown leather sectional in our living room that we spent a fortune on about ten years ago, but after two rough kids (who still have growing to do) it's faded and worn. Couldn't bear to give it up -- both financially as well as emotionally, since I love it so much -- not to mention the fact that my kids are still too young to even think about a new piece they'll just ruin with their normal chaos. :)After reading the reviews on here and other leather sites, decided to go for the Light Brown. Couldn't decide between this and the next shade up (medium brown) but read that it's best to go with the lighter shade. Now that I've started, I could have absolutely gone even lighter -- these colors are very saturated and cover extremely well -- but I'm super happy, even with it SLIGHTLY darker than it started.Spent a few hours redying part of our living room leather sectional and ran out of the 4oz bottle midway, so if you have a large area to cover you might want to consider buying more than one bottle. As a result of running out (and the fact that I forgot to begin with), though, I took a comparison shot that, honestly, says it all:i47.tinypic.com/349cgf9.jpgLike other reviewers have said, be warned that it DOES stain everything, so take care to lay down towels, tarps, have plenty of rags, etc. The light brown did stain my hands, but most of the obvious coloring came off with soap, water, and rubbing alcohol. What little is left just turned my hands a slightly yellowish tint (I was wearing gloves -- it saturated through them).I used unscented baby wipes, like other reviewers have suggested, to prep. Also had a bottle of rubbing alcohol on hand -- it wasn't suggested, but since these dyes are alcohol based I knew I would thin it out. Had a few spots where the coverage was too heavy (where the leather wasn't as faded) so used some alcohol on a rag and rubbed lightly to thin it out so it graded from the old to the new nicely (I didn't dye the entire thing, just the faded parts).If you have a faded leather piece (shoes, furniture, horse equipment, etc.) that you can't bear to let go of, I HIGHLY recommend Fiebing's. Very old company, superior quality, super cheap price...couldn't possibly ask for more.\"},\n",

The fiebings leather dye comes with a real applicator, which takes the mystery out of how much you're applying. Kiwi comes in a weird bottle-tube thing, and you never know how much is going to come out of the tip. Fiebings, on the other hand, has a little brush applicator, like you would use if you were a real grownup! (Seriously, this is not for kids, though.) It relies a bit more on the user being careful and cautious, using it with a little common sense. That being said, the dye itself seems deeper and more lustrous than Kiwi.One thing to keep in mind, though, is that before apply the dye, you want to deglaze the leather with -- yep, you guessed it: Fiebeings leather deglazer. The deglazer takes off the old polish so that the dye can actually soak into the leather -- otherwise, it can tend to just bead up on the polish and not soak in properly. So deglaze your leather, then apply the dye, then let that dry. To finish up, if you want a shine on it, you can put some polish on there, too.\"},\n",

Seems like a small thing, but when your hands are busy and mucky from working in the kitchen, not being able to just reach over, pull out the scissors & use them drives me crazy. Poor design. And then, as others have noted, the red lock often slips around & relocks the scissors. Disappointment from a company that's put out so many well-designed, sturdy, affordable kitchen tools.\"},\n",

You\\'d have to oil them up after every use, and since they do not come apart (not purposefully), they are not easy to clean. You could toss them in the dishwasher, but say hello to rust in no time.Some have commented on the locking system, if you hold them upside down first, you can easily \"flick\" the lock off one handed, but you\\'d then have to reverse them to use them. So unlocking them is not a two handed affair, but eventually you\\'ll have to pass them off from one hand to the other, or flip them around \"gunslinger\" style for one handed operation.While these are very comfortable scissors, I\\'d pass on these for a solid pair of poultry shears that come apart for easy cleaning. Now for cutting paper and being a pair of craft scissors outside of the kitchen, these scissors are great for that purpose. But a pair of scissors that rust easily does not belong in the kitchen.'},\n",

The little red clip that holds the handles together always stays in place without any modification. Also, they have never come apart. I have had mine for over six months and use them almost everyday all around the house. From cutting paper to plant stems, they have always worked beautifully. They are also very cool to look at. Friends that have seen and/or used them have praised them as well. I do confess that I did not get mine through amazon.com. Perhaps amazon had a bad batch or something, or maybe I got lucky.

These have been a great set of shears for me and get lots of regular use. They have been tossed in the dishwasher plenty of times. Although these scissors don\\'t seem to be particularly sharp, my needs for them are mainly cutting through product packaging (like cereal bags) or to poke through the tape to open an Amazon box. They don\\'t need to be super sharp for those purposes, but I don\\'t think they would work well for serious cutting needs. The red clip does have an annoying habit of tipping over when you least want it to, thus quite often preventing you from making the cut you want. I like that these shears can be locked with that annoying clip and stored safely in a drawer. So...they\\'re good for my uses, but won\\'t \"cut it\" for everyone.'},\n",

The OXO scissors will cut through single sheets of paper, but when it comes to getting into a package of plastic-wrapped meat these scissors literally can't hack it.Do yourself a favor. Kitchen scissors are important, so splurge on a decent pair. I replaced the OXO scissors with a pair from Wusthof.

There is a little plastic thing that swivels to lock the handles together. This is a nice safety feature. Provided, it is not a strong lock and any child with thumbs can still open the scissors, but it is nice to avoid reaching in a drawer and slicing yourself on scissors that opened from being squished with other utensils and knives (admit it, we all have those kinds of drawers).#2 - The handles are comfortable. One of the things I dislike about using scissors is that my hands are uncomfortable against the hard plastic or metal handles.Though I have not used them for cutting boneless chicken breast into strips, I have seen friends use it for this. Evidently, they've had much luck with food uses (cutting chives, for instance). The scissors come clean in the dishwasher and I've not noticed they rust.Comfortable and useful. A great pair to have on-hand, even if you just use them for cutting twine, gift wrap, and clipping off price tags.\"},\n",

Also, I experienced the same problem as other reviewers, where the red latch will try to close during use. With a toddler into everything at home, I like the safety feature of the latch, but it's very awkward during use. Finally, cleaning these scissors leaves much to be desired. The blades don't come apart, so the only way to really get them clean is in the dishwasher. After about three washes, I noticed some rust spots on the blades!

And not everyone who has pierced ears has had to have the back surgically removed because it got sucked up into the back of the ear. But, let me just assure you... It ain\\'t fun being on either side of the situation. We were getting ready to go to one of our daughter\\'s dance competitions when she flew to me in a panic. \"Mom! I can\\'t get the back off my earring and I need to change into my competition earrings!\" My first glimpse at the situation just about brought me to my knees... I could barely see the tops of the earring backs...Her skin has just grown right up over them. That was it for me. I went online and immediately ordered these safety earring backs which, due to the wide plate around nut, prevent the ear from enveloping the back. This is just one of those items that you don\\'t really think of as being important until you have an emergency situation. Now... We don\\'t wear post earrings without them.'},\n",

They have less toxic melted plastic smell and flowed more easily than the generic sticks I had. The price was good so added it to another order for free shipping. I highly recommend these for crafts etc.I used it to glue some plastic parts together for an electronics project I was putting together. Worked great: strong join yet not too difficult to pick off after cooling. Just what I was hoping for.'},\n",

I suppose we MIGHT be able to jam 2 or 3 of these into the input of a glue gun, but I haven't tried that yet. I've never even seen a glue gun that these would &#34;natively&#34; fit in...So, &#34;caveat emptor&#34; -- if you want TINY glue sticks, these are what you want.

If the seam allowances were just a tiny bit off, then the quilt would never fit together properly. I started punching a little hole in the template wherever the seam ends. Then all you have to do is match the little dots on the two pieces you are sewing. You just sew from one point to the next.

       "  'review/text': 'I bought these to punch holes in aluminum beer, soda, and juice cans.I make alcohol burning cook stoves. Most I give away; but a friend sells some of them on eBay.Before I could use this punch for my purposes; I had to heavily modify it.First I used needle nosed pliers and obliterated the paper guide so I could get the punch over the rim of the can si I could punch the jets for the stove.Second I used a screw driver to pop off the basket that catches the little pieces of aluminum because I needed to see exactly the jet locations.Those two things went fine, and the punch makes nice smooth holes.So why give the punch only four stars? Two reasons.1. The cushioned handles. I have no idea what the cushion grips are made of, but I can hardly wait for the cushion grips to fall off; in fact I am tempted to cut them off because the word Fuskars embossed in the handle, and the non slip texture could easily cause blisters if you have to make a lot of holes.2. The punch is too short and the small disc often sticks inside the base and you have to use a toothpick or similar to pop out the disc so you can see to punch the next disc. If the punch was 1/32 of an inch or 1 millimeter longer thhe punch would completely pass through the base this problem would be solved.'},\n",

       "  'review/text': 'My old, basic, school supply-style hole punch recently stopped working correctly and was unfixable, so I ordered this new Fiskars one, and was excited to receive it, as I figured that after all these years (actually decades) of time, the technology would\\'ve been improved to make these hole punches so much easier and more comfortable to use -- and much to my surprise, I was wrong. The only thing about this that makes it more comfortable than my old metal one, is the handles, and even then, they\\'re not what I\\'d call comfortable, but they feel better than the solid metal ones. That doesn\\'t matter to me as much as the smoothness of how this punches -- it certainly works and does the job to punch holes, but it\\'s hard and choppy and not \"smooth as buttah\" as I thought the newest modern punches would be by now, especially from a company as respected for high-quality craft items as Fiskars. So, a bit of a disappointment there, but this punch will certainly serve my purposes, and I just hope I don\\'t ever need to punch a whole LOT of holes at once, because this would make my hand very sore!'},\n",

This year they will also receive sets.A problem mentioned in reviews was that several color-sticks slid out the back,so...I took my daughter's nail polish and painted each top, placing them in awater glass to dry without smearing. A second painting gave a nice finish.This should keep the stick from sliding out either end due to the vacuumeffect.Among the colors in the 24 are silver & gold; very nice selection.\"},\n",

Unfortunately, after releasing the trigger, the glue continues to flow from the tip. Some drip is typical of most glue guns however, this gun really releases a lot of extra glue.

       "  'review/text': 'Over the years I\\'ve had several glue guns, from the $4.99 ones to larger $15 models, but none of them come close to what the Dremel has to offer.1) It feels sturdy and has a nice flat surface below the cord to keep it upright plus a one-finger release of the stand on the front2) It has 2 temperature settings. I can see \"low\" being handy for arts and crafts, but for a good bond on plastic \"high\" is perfect. Once glued the sticks are really well bonded, unlike some of the cheaper models3) Several glue tips are included, for different styles of work4) A nice large trigger makes pushing the sticks through easy workSome minor cons; the \"anti drip\" feature doesn\\'t really work, you\\'ll still get some dripping so make sure the tip is over something to catch the glue. On \"high\" it takes around 6 minutes to heat up, which is pretty long, but like I said before; hot glue bonds better.All in all a very nice kit for a low price, save yourself the hassle of a bad glue gun and get this one. It\\'ll last for years.'},\n",

       "  'review/text': \"I frequently use glue guns in my work and searched and searched for one that was well designed - my search is over now that I have found the Dremel. This was obviously user-designed.The features I was looking for were:1) Stability - most glue guns have wimpy wire stands and easily tip over. The Dremel has a large, flat 'heel' and large plastic 'kick-stand' that keep the gun from tipping over. The stand locks into position against the body of the gun when not in use and is easily released with a push of a button. Also, the cord is well located and very flexible which contributes to the stability.2) Drip-less - As others have mentioned, it is not 100% drip-less, but mine has very minimal dripping - less than others I've used. Also, it's important to read the instructions. The drip-less feature is only activated when the stand is in the down position. If you lay the gun on it's side with the stand up it will drip a lot - you have to put the stand down to decrease the flow of glue.3) On/Off switch - This is the only glue gun I've found that has an on/off switch. It is nice not to have to pull the plug between uses.4) Indicator lights. This is a nice touch.Even though this is not a mini glue gun, it is light weight and very trim, making it very comfortable to handle. Plus there are three tips for different applications and they are very easy to change.Oh...did I mention the price? I would have paid twice the amount for the quality this product offers - but happy I didn't have to!Thanks Dremel for putting so much thought into the design of this glue gun!\"},\n",

That didn't make or break the product for me, but it has to be said because their description is misleading, to say the least.It comes with different nozzles, has two heat settings, stands on it's own fine and the kickstand works well. A built in on switch so it doesn't have to be unplugged to shut if off is nice. It's got a work light, but I think it would have been better to position it over the glue coming out, rather than below it, unless you work with the side of the gun facing you. A red and green light tell you when the temp is optimal. Overall, I'm happy with the product.\"},\n",

When it does it drips glue all over the place. If this was an isolated incident it would be acceptible, but I bought two of these lemons for work. We hate to use them because of the dripping. I have to put a piece of cardboard under it to keep it from making a big mess.I previously had Arrow Fastener glue guns. No light, no dual temp setting, just a simple glue gun and stand with a drip catcher. It didnt drip that much however. Too bad they got old and needed to be replaced.I give it three stars because it heats up and glues. Whats with the light anyway? A lot of people glue in the dark and need a blue light?saxman'},\n",

The toy space isn't very large and the hinge also interferes with some of the space, but it's perfect for smaller spaces. it also works very well as a bench. My biggest criticism is related to Amazon's packaging of the toy chest. They shipped it in the manufacturer's box which is flimsy cardboard and the pieces of the toy chest are not well packaged inside the box. The first one I ordered (using Prime) arrived with broken pieces. The Amazon rep was great and replaced it with even faster shipping. I think if she hadn't done that and the second box had to spend more time in delivery, it probably would have also arrived broken because the second box also looked worn and some of the inner styrofoam was broken. it's just not packed well inside the box and not well protected. Otherwise, the product itself is great.\"},\n",

The bobbins hold fast inside the saver and don't unwind, but are easy enough to retrieve out of it when you want to use them. Plus the donut shape makes it easy to hang up and keep out of the way, even in stacks. It's rubbery and well made so it will last forever. It's also cool that the Bobbinsavers come in different colors so the bobbins for different types of threads can be kept separated and organized. I've lived for quite a while with just one Saver because it holds lots of bobbins, but a recent bulk purchase of different colored threads has me looking forward to getting a couple more BobbinSavers so I can prewind more bobbins and keep them handy.\"},\n",

I actually prefer the shorter lengths with the larger hooks, such as the Lion Brand 15mm hook:Lion Brand Yarn 15mm Crochet Hook, Size Q-19and the lightweight plastic on the Lion Brand 19mm hook.Crochet Hook-S-35However, the short length on the 10mm hook feels a bit awkward. Though I think it might make a great hook for children. The other disappointment is the hook shown in the picture for this product is the P15 11.50mm in Seafoam Green, though the description does accurately describe the size. It appears that the P15 11.50mm hook has been discontinued or replaced by the P15 10mm hook, so IMO it should not appear in pictures or in descriptions as the 10mm hook if it isn\\'t being sold.'},\n",

I haven't tried it with lighter yarns or other materials yet. At first the hook feels very weird because it's so large compared to the hooks I usually use (F, G, H). But it was easy to get used to and worked well. In fact, it was so easy to count my chain stitches that I would even recommend this to a beginner at crochet because you can easily see what you're doing.I'm looking forward to trying this hook with fabric and other non-yarn materials.\"},\n",

It is something easy and inexpensive to fix adding a small thin piece of leather or an extra clamp in the supporting screws (make sure you have the right size bringing the screw to the hardware store with you), adding more pressure and friction between the wood and the screws when tighten.I like to draw standing up so I use the polystyrene the easel came packed with to add some height and protect the table I use from scratching it.

       "  'review/text': \"I considered several styles of easel before settling on this one and it turned out to be a better bargain than I expected. It has the dimensions of a briefcase with a briefcase-style handle. It's well constructed and the latches that hold everything together when it's not in use are well placed (not in the way). No assembly is required - it's easy to set up and take down and is compact enough to be stored just about anywhere. The base has a pleasing heft and seems to hold just about anything without tipping. It's sturdy enough to be weighted down, should it come to that. The drawer has 4 roomy compartments and can be completely pulled out, which is nice.I'm using this easel on an eat-in bar in my kitchen. I'm not very tall so it puts the easel at the right height for me to work comfortably while standing or sitting on a stool. It can be adjusted to hold something much larger than you would think possible for something so compact. The larger items will just hang over the edge. Fully extended, the easel accommodates a range of angles from perfectly flat to 90 degrees (upright) but it will tilt forward by another 45 degrees if you do not extend the bottom adjustment. I expect to get a lot of mileage out of this easel.\"},\n",

       "  'review/text': 'I needed a table easel and there is a good bit to choose from....so, which to get? A.) THIS ONE. And I will explain why. A lot of table easels will extend up and accommodate a larger canvas, but this one also can be adjusted to \"lower\" the bottom portion as well as the upper portion. This creates a larger area to work. In doing so, it relocates the drawer that is typically in the front side and places it on the right side. In this drawer can be stored paints and brushes and it has two clasps to keep it closed securely while carrying it around...the part of the easel that holds the canvas condenses (if expanded above or below) and can be lowered and secured as well.....it essentially folds together securely and has a leather handle to carry it by. It\\'s constructed of solid wood and by that I mean it\\'s strong enough to be adjusted without worrying that something is going to snap while adjusting the easel up and down and it travels well. When I purchased this item it was one of the more expensive models but you really do get what you pay for. Look at it as an investment because if you buy something of lesser quality, you\\'re stuck with it and if you buy this (from my personal experience with the easel) you\\'re going to have a better experience in the way it accommodates an even larger canvas, stores your supplies safely and securely with TWO \"good\" clasps, a reliable & sturdy leather handle, a solid wood built frame that can be adjusted easily and when properly secured it will stay at the angle you set it at. The more I use it, the happier I am I bought it.'},\n",

They didn't come with a setter, and the store didn't carry any for the size (3/16'').Since I'm a college student, it's almost second nature to look for something 1: cheap. 2: has multiple uses. The Universal Eyelet Setter has both those qualities. Like the description says, it has extensions for 1/16'', 1/8'', and 3/16'' eyelets. It also comes with a hole punch extension. The directions are printed on the back of the package, and it is quite easy to handle The only problem I had was that the extensions would unscrew a little when I hammer the tool--though it's easily rectified by screwing them on a little tighter. I've put in about 50 eyelets in under an hour which is awesome compared to the tool I used to have.I've put it through two layers of velvet with a layer of interfacing in between with little problem. I'm sure paper would be a breeze. I love it so far, and I'm sure that I'll be using the setter for a long time!\"},\n",

I recommend that if it does come apart accidentally to use some wood glue. I did notice that the manufacturer did not use glue, or if they did, it is not much.I highly recommend this piece to painters. I am a novice, but this is the best crafted canvas stand I have seen yet, and I am very excited to use it.For the canvas' that have canvas stretched around four boards with the staples on the back side, you can put the canvas on the top piece of wood (the one that is like two inches by two inches). This gives the painter the room he needs to paint the edges, and they will not get ruined, as the canvas is suspended from the holding dock.This is just wonderful. I can only keep telling everyone that this is a very well made painters stand.Sit down, relax, have a cup of tea, put on some Mozart, and begin.\"},\n",

Here is a list of the things I can say about this machine:1- The decorative stitches are a lot and are really nice, although I wish they could be a little bigger in size.2- The embroidery works great, but of course it's not a professional embroidery machine, so it takes a lot of time to do embroidery with it because you have to change the needle thread as many times as the number of colors you need.3- There is a lot of useful feet that comes with the package: buttonhole foot, button making foot, overlock foot, embroidery foot, basting foot, ...Overally, I give this 5 stars because I really enjoy sewing with this machine and it has never disappointed me.\"},\n",

The hinge was loose on one of the cases, which was no big deal. My husband fixed it fairly easily. The other issue was that there is no liner in them, and since this is a larger case than a standard jewelry showcase, the velvet inserts that are on Amazon are too small. I considered buying velvet and making my own liner, but I ended up using a cloth carpet material, cutting it to fit, and using glue to secure it to the bottom. It doesn't look all that great, and it would be better if they offered a velvet insert on Amazon to buy with this case. It is neat though that it is actually two cases in one, and I like that it secures with a lock.\"},\n",

In the end I found that if I gently continued turning the thumbscrew, the foot bracket did indeed yield and I got a snug, square attachment to the presser bar. I sewed some tests with that foot attached and it worked as I hoped it would. Overall I am quite satisfied with my purchase: seller, product, and price are great.

Once assembled, (took about 20 minutes), I was pleased that the easel was a solid piece of studio furniture. Mine is sitting on a heavy canvas tarp on carpet, and it is very stable on this rather springy surface. The easel design is nice allowing the canvas space to move in just about whatever angle you need to have a comfortable painting experience. I especially like that it lays flat so if I wanted to, I could use it as a table when sketching my work onto canvas. This is the perfect easel for the space I have it in.\"},\n",

I have just purchased my second pair - I simply could not applique without them. These are the ONLY sissors I've found that give me the result I'm looking for.\"},\n",

I often use the scissors for more than an hour at a time, and there is much less hand-fatigue with these Fiskars than any other scissors I've used. They have a similar shape the the Tim Holtz Tonic scissors [ASIN:B0013JNERS Tonic Studios Tim Holtz 817 Kushgrip Non Stick Micro Serrated Snips], but I find the blades of the Fiskars to be sharper and easier to open and close. The Tonic snips are good for cutting thicker, tough things (even metal), but I use the Fiskars for almost everything else.I've been using these scissors almost every day for the past 10 months, and the blades are still as sharp as when I received it. Ordered a second pair so that I will always have a pair handy.Pros: Sharp, precise, smooth-cutting, and lasting bladesrubber-lined, large, comfortable handlesCons: No cons, but I wouldn't use it for cutting thick, tough items\"},\n",

They are well worth the extra cost to get a high quality product. I use mine on 1-2 inch wide ribbons and fabric. The cuts are very precise and all edges are clean. The tooth size on this is what I would call a \"medium\" size, which is perfect for ribbons, or much like the edges of your childhood ribbon awards. I would not recommend using these on paper or cardboard-- this will ruin them for fabric. Get a separate set for your scrapbooking and other crafty needs.

The soft grip would be nice IF they were easier to open & close.I did not realize this issue because as soon as I got them, I gave the packaged shears to a friend who was cutting out dog bandannas for a rescue fund raiser we had scheduled. She does not sew so she did not know they were supposed to be easier to open etc. She just returned the unused fabric & shears, which is past the 30 day return period.When I tried to use them yesterday on some cotton broad cloth, I was shocked at how hard they were to open and close. Silicone spray didn\\'t help. My husband and I tried a number of things to try to get them to open more easily. At the end of cutting the pattern, I had the beginning of a blister on my lower thumb where the \"soft grip\" rubbed my thumb constantly when trying to use the shears....These would go back IF it was within the return period.'},\n",

None of the tops seal. . . not very safe for acid use. One of the tops had a square cut top to fit into a round hole. . NOTThe glass dippers were another story. One was so long the top would not even fit the bottle. The others were so short the bottle would have to be half full in order for the dipper to reach the liquid.I contacted FindingKing and was told to return for a full refund. Off to the Post Office and $10.20 shipping to return $13.98 worth of bottles. Now it cost me $3.78 to shop with FindingKing.I e-mailed customer service and they responded to now throw away the bottles and I would receive a full refund. Hummm the told me the day before I had to return the product.I contact customer service again and was told they needed to have a copy of my ship receipt. Did that and was told President of Company needed to sign refund check. . . .unless I wanted a refund via PayPal. That was 10 days ago still no return shipping refund.Save your money and find something else for \"Acid\"'},\n",

They don\\'t cut very fast, or easily for that matter, and I always end up with hand cramps if I have much to cut. Recently, I had to cut hundreds of 9\" long pennants out of various vintage fabrics. The pennants were then strung on cording to create long stretches of hand-crafted banners and placed throughout the lawns for an outdoor wedding. No way was I going to be able to do that many pennants with regular pinking shears. I\\'ve always been happy with my straight-edge rotary cutter; so I ordered the pinking blade. While it definitely made the job of cutting out hundreds of pennants MUCH easier, I was disappointed with the finished edge. The sawtooth on the rotary blade doesn\\'t make the same crisply pointed zigzag edge as the pinking shears do.'},\n",

The bad news it the plastic door that covers the threading paths for the upper and lower looper threads is very fragile. To get it open, you must gently pull in down and sideways to the right. I broke a small plastic tab on the lower right edge of the door. Without it, the machine jams every time I use it. Here's another piece of bad news. The Euro-Pro website doesn't have the serger model 101-548 in its list of products. So I can't get any information on repairing my machine from the company.Therefore, I would recommend caution and gentleness when using this kind of serger.\"},\n",

To get 10X magnification, you put two lenses together and look through both simultaneously. Since diopters are additive, you get twice the magnification. To get 15X, you look through all three lenses. But, putting these three lenses in series makes for a very cloudy image, even after carefully cleaning them.These points should have been stated.

       "  'review/text': \"Kershaw is definitely a major brand name in the knife industry, but they aren't known for making fly tying tools. When fly tiers go to replace a pair of worn out scissors, the Kershaw brand doesn't often pop into our minds. I almost found these Kershaw Skeeter I & II fly tying scissors by accident. Being a big fan of Kershaw knives dating back to the days when Dan Kershaw designed knives for Gerber and still made one-off custom blades on the side, I decided I probably couldn't lose by giving them a try at roughly $16 per pair ($14.95 and $16.95 respectively). Typically, a quality pair of fly tying scissors will cost between $20 and $40. So $16 was certainly easy enough on the wallet to try something different from a brand I trust.These Kershaw fly tying scissors are great! I replaced Dr. Slick Tungsten-carbide scissors I was very happy with for quite a few years with these scissors. They are a lot lighter, more comfortable, and make more precise cuts through a wider variety of materials than the Dr. Slick scissors ever did (6 years of professional fly tying). We'll see how long they last, but at this price they can last half as long as the long-lasting Dr. Slick Tungsten-carbides and still be a superior value.\"},\n",

As the battery power runs low, the rotation of the blades slows down and snags and pulls the lint on the clothes. Therefore, you have to replace the batteries and later on experience the same power problem again. I would never recommend any battery-operated shaver.As for this RazorTek Rechargeable shaver, I agree with the previous reviews that this is a terrible shaver. I was frustrated with it also. So why did I give it 5 stars?? It is a great shaver IF YOU REMOVE THE 3 SPEED H/M/L ADJUSTABLE CAP (this is the black plastic circular cap protecting the stainless steel cover)!!! This black cap PREVENTS you from achieving a close shave of your fabric and it will pull on the lint. You will have to press very hard onto the fabric to shave the lint with this black cap on.ONCE THIS BLACK CAP IS REMOVED, THUS EXPOSING THE STAINLESS STEEL COVER, YOU CAN A CLEAN AND EXCELLENT SHAVE!! The blades are closer to the steel cover and you will NOT have to press down on your fabric too much. Since it is a rechargeable, the speed of the rotation of the blades is always fast and never dies very quickly like batteries. NO SNAGGING OR PULLING. I have charged it only once and I haven\\'t recharged since then. The lint chamber is of adequate size...it holds a lot unless you\\'re too lazy to open and empty it. I have shaved several items (e.g. sweaters, socks, pants, etc.) before emptying the chamber and they look smooth and great. If you purchase this item, REMEMBER TO REMOVE THE BLACK \"ADJUSTABLE\" CAP!!'},\n",

I could hear something moving in the handle. For 13 bucks I figured I'd take it apart to see what was going on. What did I discover? the positive connection solder on the 500mah NiCad battery had broken. 500mah - to drive a motor. You'll never get more than 10-15min of use out of a junk battery like this, and the solder was so thin, I can't imagine this will hold up for any extended use.Look elsewhere.\"},\n",
